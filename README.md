A Python Billing System is a desktop application designed to automate the process of generating bills in retail shops, restaurants, or any business requiring invoice management. It is developed using Python with Tkinter as the GUI (Graphical User Interface) library.

The system provides a user-friendly interface where the cashier or shop owner can enter product details, quantities, and prices. Based on the input, the application calculates the subtotal, taxes (GST/VAT), discounts (if any), and the final total bill. It can also generate a printable bill/invoice for the customer.
